<h3>Requiem for a Dream</h3>
<p>This movie messed me up! But incredible story, acting, solidified that Aronofsky is one of my favorite directors</p>
<h3>The Other Guys</h3>
<p>This movie is so ridiculous and over the top, it makes me laugh every time. One of those movies that no matter when it's on, I'll stop and watch it.</p>
<h3>The Departed</h3>
<p>First Scorcese movie that came to mind.</p>
